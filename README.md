This example highlights a subtle bug in COBOL that can occur when using the REDEFINES clause along with various data manipulation operations.  Incorrect usage of REDEFINES with arithmetic, MOVE, and DISPLAY statements can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption.

The `bug.cob` file demonstrates the problem where data is modified in one area and unexpectedly changes in other redefined areas.  The `bugSolution.cob` provides a solution using explicit data movement to avoid such errors.  The example focuses on using PIC 9(5) and PIC X(95) fields for illustrative purposes.  The exact manifestation of this bug can vary based on the complexity of the program and the specific data manipulations involved.
